```bash
bin/console make:user

 The name of the security user class (e.g. User) [User]:
 > 

 Do you want to store user data in the database (via Doctrine)? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 Enter a property name that will be the unique "display" name for the user (e.g. email, username, uuid) [email]:
 > 

 Will this app need to hash/check user passwords? Choose No if passwords are not needed or will be checked/hashed by some other system (e.g. a single sign-on server).

 Does this app need to hash/check user passwords? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 created: src/Entity/User.php
 created: src/Repository/UserRepository.php
 updated: src/Entity/User.php
 updated: config/packages/security.yaml

           
  Success! 
           

 Next Steps:
   - Review your new App\Entity\User class.
   - Use make:entity to add more fields to your User entity and then run make:migration.
   - Create a way to authenticate! See https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html
```

comme c'est une entitÃ©, il faut faire ...

```bash
bin/console ma:mi
bin/console d:m:m
```

## hash-password

```bash
bin/console security:encode

 !                                                                                                                     
 ! [CAUTION] The use of the "security:encode-password" command is deprecated since version 5.3 and will be removed in  
 !           6.0. Use "security:hash-password" instead.
